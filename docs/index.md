# The Jeo Keyboard Layout

_Aug 25, 2018 &nbsp;&middot; 7 min read_

Jeo is a keyboard layout which is optimised for software development.  It looks
like this:

![The Jeo Keyboard Layout](/images/iso-desktop.png)

Weird, right?  I won’t say it’s _the_ optimal layout, but if you’re sitting on
something which offers any significant improvements (and still works on an
off-the-shelf USB keyboard) then I’d love to hear about it!

I’ve been using Jeo in production for a little over 3 years now; in a word,
it’s been _delightful_.  It took me about 2 days to get to grips with (YMMV, of
course), and since then I’ve just been making little tweaks here and there to
maximise the awesomeness.  I’m pleased to announce[^announce] that there
haven’t been any ill-effects; unless you count raised eyebrows, confused
coworkers, and an inability to type ‘normally’ in interviews, in which case
there have been many ill-effects.[^ill-effects]  On the whole, it’s been
a blast; I will be sticking with Jeo for the foreseeable future, and
I wholeheartedly recommend that you start using it too.

[^announce]:
    People being ‘pleased to announce’ their achievements on LinkedIn is my
    current pet hate.

[^ill-effects]:
    Don’t worry, though, I got the job!

## Why?

By virtue of the fact that you’re reading this, I’m going to assume that you’ve
already ditched QWERTY and embarked on an alternative layout pilgrimage.  Maybe
you’re a Dvorak user (cute), or a Colemak fan (somewhat respectable, save for
the fact that you can’t type ‘the’ without wincing), but either way you
understand that there are more important factors in key arrangement than making
it so that you can spell ‘typewriter’ using only the top row.

Obviously, claiming that QWERTY is worse for the world than the US remake of
[Skins][] would be hollow without some data to back it up.  Fortunately,
[Martin Krzywinski][] has produced a [‘fully-baked parametric model of typing
effort’][carpalx] that we can rely on.  I recommend giving his Carpalx study
a read if you have time; here are the headline results if you don’t:

Jeo uses Krzywinski’s QGMLWY letter mask, which is [fully optimised][] for
typing in English, and happens to keep some common shortcut keys (ZXCV) in
their familiar locations.

## But I write _software_, not novels!

Sure.  Optimising the letter mask for natural language is not the same as
optimising for variable names and programming language keywords, but I’m
willing to bet that you type more words in English (comments, docstrings, Slack
messages) than you do in actual code, so QGMLWY is still a good fit.

What you also need are numbers, navigation keys, and – most importantly
– symbols.  Jeo has you covered here.  It provides dedicated symbol and
navigation layers that are heavily inspired by [Neo][], a German programmer
layout.  Everything you need is available on top of the conventional letter
keys, so you never need to move your fingers more than one key from their
resting position.

At this point, you may be wondering whether it’s valid to assume that the
symbols and the letters should be on separate layers.  It’s a very good
question; some symbols are used a lot when coding (brackets, commas,
semicolons) – possibly more often than the least common letters!  In principle,
you could mix the letters and symbols into two masks – primary and secondary,
say – but it becomes difficult to reason about.  Krzywinski makes some
[interesting observations][] on this topic.

## Original Content

Although _most_ of Jeo is cherry-picked from Carpalx and Neo, it does come with
a few tricks of its own.  Some of these seem a little peculiar at first sight;
they’ve basically developed organically through continued usage.

### Backspace, escape and return

These three keys are super important, but on almost _every_ other layout
they’re relegated to the far corners of the keyboard.  Jeo resolves this issue
by bringing them all _inside_ the traditional ISO (L-shaped) return key.

![Backspace, escape and return](/images/backspace-escape-return.png)

Jeo’s logical `Return` key is agnostic of whether you’re using an ANSI or an
ISO physical keyboard – effectively, you always have the so-called ‘big-ass
enter’ at your fingertips.

### Media keys

You can’t write a test suite  without music, and you can’t listen to music
without being interrupted.  This makes volume and playback controls a staple of
any software engineer’s keyboard.  Jeo makes them easier to hit than a regular
keyboard by putting them to the right of the number row.

![Media keys](/images/media-keys.png)

The play/pause button occupies the huge key formally known as backspace, making
it an easy target to hit when startled; the volume controls are right next
door.  Mute, previous and next are accessible through the same keys but on the
symbol/navigation layers (either will work – it’s not like you have time to
choose when you’ve accidentally started blasting out Union J to the whole
office).

## Variants

As you may have noticed, the image at the top of this page is of an ISO
keyboard.  Jeo works with ANSI too (through you may wish to sacrifice your left
Alt for the Nav key), and I am sure it can be equally-well adapted to whatever
fancy split Topre ortholinear keyboard you have sitting in front of
you.[^endgame]  Here’s a little inspiration:

[^endgame]:
    If you do happen to be the proud owner of a split Topre ortholinear
    keyboard, please let me know how you acquired it!  I want one.

## Infrequently Asked Questions

### How do I start using Jeo?

Check out the README on [GitHub][].

[GitHub]: https://github.com/joecridge/jeo

### Why is it called ‘Jeo’?

Jeo’s symbol and navigation layers are inspired by _Neo_, a layout for
German-speaking programmers.  Also, ‘Jeo’ is the way I kept mis-spelling my
name while I was starting out with the layout.

### Does it work with Vim?

An excellent question.  The answer is yes – surprisingly well.  J and K are
still next to each other, but now you have one under each index finger, rather
than both sharing the right hand.  H and L are ‘the wrong way around’, but this
is something you get used to very quickly; when you do, you’ll realise that
having W and L as neighbours (and likewise for B and H) is pretty neat – you
can easily ‘seek’ left or right, first by word, then by letter.  If none of
that floats your boat, though, `noremap` is just a buffer away…

It goes without saying that having escape moved closer is a godsend, but
presumably you already did something about that in your old layout.

### How did you draw the fancy geometries?

Using the fantastic [keyboard-layout-editor.com][editor].  You can check out
the sources [on GitHub][geometries].

[editor]: http://keyboard-layout-editor.com/
[geometries]: https://github.com/joecridge/jeo/tree/master/docs/geometries

### What exactly do the legends on the geometries mean?

Oops… you’ve noticed that the markings aren’t exactly consistent.  The
geometries are intended mainly as a mnemonic; if I drew out the layers
precisely, it would all get very cluttered!

Since you’ve asked, there are (broadly speaking) four different types of key:

#### Modifiers

![Modifiers](/images/modifiers.png)

These are marked in yellow; they’re the simplest type of key, only having one
action (regardless of which other modifiers are also held down).

#### Media keys

![Media keys](/images/media-keys.png)

These are the three keys in the top right which are _also_ marked in yellow.
The upper legend is what you get when you ordinarily press them; the lower
legend is what you get when `Symbol` or `Nav` are held down.

#### Number keys

![Number keys](/images/number-keys.png)

As you might have guessed, this is the top row of keys in white.  As you might
also have guessed, the number is what you get when you ordinarily press them.
The upper legend is the symbol that you get while holding down `Symbol`, and
the front legend is the function key that gets sent when you hold down `Nav`.
The `Shift` modifier has no effect on number keys.

#### Letter keys

![Letter keys](/images/letter-keys.png)

These are the rest of the white keys.  You ordinarily get the lower- or
upper-cased letter (top legend), depending on whether `Shift` is held down.
There are a few ‘letter’ keys which have two punctuation characters as their
upper legend (e.g. `/?`).  The first character is what you get without `Shift`,
and the second is what you get with `Shift`.

For all letter keys, the lower legend is what you get with `Symbol`, and the
front legend is what you get with `Nav`.
